# python-things
The only cool things I hacked together in my Intro Python Class.

_conway.py_ is a Conway's Game of Life simulator that I spent way too much time on.

_fivecard.py_ is a Five Card Draw head to head poker game v.s. an A.I. that I spent too much time on.  The code is very messy, because we weren't allowed to use any OO yet.  The A.I seems very close to being a standard EHS-based algorithm, but I didn't quite make it.  The rules are also modified as per the class' instructions (see Clarifications at the top of the file).
